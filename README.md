# ARehab
ARehab is a free (as in free speech) application for physical rehab, aided by Augmented Reality technologies and user tracking systems, such as Microsoft Kinect v2. It was created during 2015 as a degree project at the [University of Granada](http://ugr.university) and the aim of this project is to serve as a physical rehab system that will be usefull for doctors and physical trainers. It's based on different technologies such as Augmented Reality, Kinect SDK v2, Qt SDK 5 (OpenSource), OpenGL, ... and it's wroten in C++.

The following screenshots show the interface design that puts first user experience and usability.

ARehab is in an early stage of development, therefore, only the source code and resources needed are distributed. The user interface is localized in Spanish, but i18n will be a feature that is in my TODOs list.
